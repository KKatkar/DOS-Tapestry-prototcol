# DOS-Tapestry-prototcol

In this project we implemented tapestry protocol using the actor facility
elixir , implemented the network join and routing as described in the
Tapestry paper. We were able to route the requests over a dynamically built
tapestry network. Here, we are taking numNodes and num requests as an
input. <br />
**Provide the input in following form :**
mix run project3.exs numNodes numRequests

<h3>Results</h3>
The largest network we were able to deal with had the number of nodes as
12500 and number of requests as 5 where the max hop count was found to
be 6 which can be seen README.pdf
